Here you can find some of my skills on C#.

## Run a Project

To run a file (or files) on macOS, you need to run the following commands on the terminal: 

If you don't have mono installed:
```bash
  brew install mono
```
To compile a C# project:
```bash
  mcs File1.cs File2.cs
```
```bash
  mono File1.exe
```
